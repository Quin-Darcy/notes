# Questions to ask Dr. Ricciotti

1. When given functions whose domain is an open interval, that are also differentiable on that open interval, can we still applie the mean value theorems whose premises' contain a statement about being continuous on the closure of the open interval? If so, how do we do that? 
   
   1. I read about continuous extensions. If $B\subset A$, $B$ is dense in $A$ and $f$ is uniformly continuous on $B$, then there exists a unique continuous extension of $f$ to $A$. Can we use this on the comps without proof?
